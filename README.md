# Java-Applications

Each folder in this repository contains a different Java project.

1. A system to optimize the storage of items in a Shop. It makes cabinet objects and store items in them according to an input file. 
   It finds the cabinet were an item was stored, or it prints "New" if the item was just created, or  it prints "Outside" if the item
   is not in the Shop anymore. Usage of HashMap and ArrayList. 

2. A variant of the classic whack-a-mole game. (Utilizing 2D arrays) eg: https://giphy.com/gifs/gifporn-MVUyVpyjakkRW

3. A system to store and process students' matric numbers and their grades:  
   Read a .txt file with students' data. 
   Comparable and Comparator implementation to sort the data.

4. Polymorphism example.

5. Recursion example: Finding a factorial number, and add by one.

6. A short method to find a rooster year according to the Chinese Horoscope.

7. Try catch example

8. Comparator Example: The program reads a .csv file, and
   stores data in an array of player objects. A comparator sorts the players
   in order of decreasing score. If players have the same score, 
   the program sorts them alphabetically by name.
   
9. A basic generics example.

10. Substring Comparisons

11. Find if a word is palindrome. 

12. Split a string into tokens.

13. A method that finds if two strings  are case-insensitive anagrams.

14. Find a happy number (using recursion).

15. A short method to check for the frequency of numbers in an array.

16. Calculation of the area of different shapes. Utilizing polymorphism.

17. A short method that finds prime numbers.
