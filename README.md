# Java-Applications

Each folder in this repository contains a different Java project.

1. A short method that finds prime numbers. 

2. Recursion example: Finding a factorial number, and add by one.

3. A system to store and process students' matric numbers and their grades:  
   Read a .txt file with students' data. 
   Comparable and Comparator implementation to sort the data.

4. Polymorphism example.

5. A variant of the classic whack-a-mole game. (Utilizing 2D arrays) eg: https://giphy.com/gifs/gifporn-MVUyVpyjakkRW

6. A short method to find a rooster year according to the Chinese Horoscope.

7. Try catch example

8. Comparator Example: The program reads a .csv file, and
   stores data in an array of player objects. A comparator sorts the players
   in order of decreasing score. If players have the same score, 
   the program sorts them alphabetically by name.
   
9. A basic generics example.

10. Substring Comparisons

11. Find if a word is palindrome. 

12. Split a string into tokens.

13. A method that finds if two strings  are case-insensitive anagrams.

14. Find negative sub arrays. 

15. Find a happy number (using recursion).

16. Find pairs of integer numbers in an array. 

17. A short method to check for the frequency of numbers in an array.
